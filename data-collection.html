      <p>At <strong>North by Nature Exclusive</strong>, we are committed to building a vibrant and inclusive community that reflects a wide range of voices, backgrounds, and experiences.</p>

      <p>As part of your application, we ask for your <strong>date of birth</strong>, <strong>gender</strong>, and <strong>ethnicity</strong>. This information allows us to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Recommend relevant content and partnership opportunities tailored to you.</li>
        <li>Support brands and businesses who are looking to work with specific demographics.</li>
        <li>Champion diversity, equality, and equal representation across all opportunities.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Many of our partners — whether in fashion, entertainment, or events — may request individuals from particular demographics for campaigns or private opportunities. By better understanding who our members are, we ensure that all backgrounds are considered and celebrated fairly.</p>

      <p>This data is collected purely to provide the best opportunities possible for you and will always remain confidential.</p>
